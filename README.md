#   Apex3D.py
#   Author: Dr. Eric Janusson
#   Python 3.7.4

#   Usage: Mass/Charge/Mobility Chromatographic Peak-Picking and Data Extraction for Waters Synapt G2 IMS-MS files.

Instructions:
Install DriftScope 2.9 to default directory: "C:\DriftScope\"
    #Note that the program will not run chromatographic-based IMS peak picking without this program installed as proprietary DLL files are required.

Install Python 3.

Move all Waters IMS-MS files (.RAW) to desired directory and copy full data directory path.

Run Apex3D.py in terminal shell.

When prompted, paste data directory and press Enter.
    #By default, all data is exported to a folder in the data directory named "Apex Output"
